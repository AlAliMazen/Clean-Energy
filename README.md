ðŸš¨**Required** 

- No doubt that the world suffers under the heavy burden of the the dirty energy and its side effects causing some parts of the world to experince unusual weather change. The Global Warming is just a sign of ho much damage we as investors have done by using the dirty energy resources including oil and coal.
- Clean-Energy sources offers the alternatives towards a world powered by clean and renewable energy. The sources of the clean energy are at the reach of every country and it application fieds are increasing tremdously. Enjoy reading and inform yourself about the sources available to the whole world and take a deep dive into each source and its components, application fields, the problem it solves and challenges by implementing.

  # UX
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

UX and why you choose or write what I did is still TODO

## Target Audience
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

All who are interested in investing in the green, renewable and sustainable energy resource and need a slight over the systems and the technologies used at very wide scope.

Domestic communiites who want to start investigating about the effectivness of replacingcurrent energy sources which comes from dirty ources including oil, coal or fossils with clean and renewable sources. It helps them drawing a path towards a decision making orientation.

## Project Goals
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

1- Clear and immersive overview on the clean energy resources.
2- Applications fields along promlems solved by clean Nergy resouces
3- Challenges to each resources and barriers prevents from implementing.


## User Stories
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

**I don't get it here what I should write**

This section lists outs as a X I want Y, so I can Z format. It helps drive out the features you will build.

You can have many kinds of users so feel free to have one section or the subsections listed or more

### Colors
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

- As the website discuss the concept of clean, renewable and sustainable energy resources, I start think of nature and its reneable sources. The first color comes in mind is therefor a green where solar system can be applied and constructued on covering green areas without effecting their fertiity for reuse. The sun has a strong dark and light yellow and this is where it comes to the first color to reflect the solar system page. As the sun is the strongest sources, I decided to make the background and hover effects takes their identity from this color.
- Wind blows but with no color, this is where the clean and white color comes in making a high contrast for the text above it.
- As a third color used for fonts and titles, I used the dark and light blue because it reflects the azure color of flowing water and it is also the color of solar panels.

- A combination dark yello, light yellow , dark blue and light blue along with white can be seen in the logo which I designed on canva website.

- The colour pallete can be found on [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palette/00296b-003f88-00509d-fdc500-ffd500)

following screenshot shows the colour theme with its hex-values
![used colour](assets/README-imgs/color-palatte.png)



### Typography
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

- discuss font size, font types for headers vs buttons vs general text and how it ties into users' emotions or target audience.
- Clarity of letters, putting a capital i next to a lower case L is always a good test
- include screenshots of fonts used and links to the appropriate website ex) https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway

### Imagery
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

Based on the topic of clean energy, each image included on the website serves nothing but introduce the visiter to see the applied system on real life projects. Following image indicates without any dout that wind energy is produced using wind turbine which has a tall and high tower with three blades and a rotator installed behind the blades. ![wind-energy-system](assets/images/nicholas-doherty.jpg)

On the other hand, the home page has a hero image which combines solar panels, wind turbines and snow which when melt will cause water flow that is the main stream for hydropower source ![home-page](assets/images/solarpanel-windmils-snow.jpg)

### Animations and Transitions
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

- discuss any special animations or transitions you've included 
- special hover state effects

## Site Structure and Features
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**


- The clean energy website is built with the idea in mind that the visiter starts totally smoothly by giving a glance about what clean energy is and an where to find its sources, moving to its applications and sum it up by a video about why to move toward clean energy.

- The website is a multi-page version with clean-energy as home and landing page. It consists of four other pages; that are, solar, wind, hydro power as they are main types of clean energy forms and a fourth join-us which includes a form where user can enter his/her infos and click the submit button.

- From the main page, user can either choose to head directly to the other sub-pages using the navigation bar which is completely resonsive to mobile screens or larger screens. Navigation uses hover effect and shows an underlined title for the active page or scroll to see 3 circles which has titles linked to the energy source. ![main-page](assets/README-img/home-page-box-shadow.png)

- The 3 Energy sources presented as circleson the website have hover effects on larger PC or laptops and when user hover over one circle the cursor turn to be a pointer , more text will be shown, the background trun to certain predefined colour and the border gets a drak blue coloured also predefined to give a visual indication that it can be clicked as in the following screen
![ce-sourcess-circles](assets/README-imgs/cl-circles-hovered.png)

- Moving on visiter will be presentet to two unordered lists explaining why clean energy good is and where it can be applied
![why-and-where-to-apply-clean-energy](assets/README-imgs/ce-lists.png)

- As last section on the home page, a short video posted by **the Economist** explaining our need to move towards **Clean Energy** in order to avoid the drastic climate changes.

- Pages like Solar, Wind and Hydropower are made up of the same structure. Each page has its own **hero image with cover text** based on the system and two other sections. The first is about the **How it works** and the second is the **System Components**
![solar-page](assets/README-imgs/ce-solar-energy-page.png)

As we can see from the above screen the table/s have also a box-shadow effect indicating that they are not floating but rather they have their own centered position and border


- Join us page is where user can write his personal information and his/her choices of preferred energy system and click on the submit button.
Fields used to collect personal data are defined as required fiedls meaning that user can leave any field empty and submit the form. Moreover the button gets used of the hover effect on PC or laptops screens.
![join us page](assets/README-imgs/join-us-page-error-submitting.png)



- The Footer provides external links to social media websites including facebook, youtube, X (twitter before), intsagram regardless where from user views the website. It is worth mentioning that both header and footer have a box-shadow to the bottom and to the top respectively to indicate their dimentions


Footer on Desktop: 
![footer-on-destop](assets/README-imgs/footer-box-shadow.png)


Footer on mobile : 
![footer-on-mobile](assets/README-imgs/footer-on-mobile.png)


- Finally the website provides a 404 Page not found mechanism provided by GitHub. The 404 page can be accessed when user types a non-existing page on the website. User will land a custom 404 page where it provides a click link to go back to the clean energy home page as in the following screen.

![404-page-not-found](assets/README-imgs/404-error-page.png)

**Note**

From any where in the webiste, user can click on the logo to go back to the home page.

# Testing


## Deployment
ðŸš¨**Required** 

### Deploy to GitHub Pages
ðŸš¨**Required** 

Based on the the course content, I applied the following steps to deploy my website to **GitHub Pages**:

1- Log in to GitHub using own credentials (username and password)

2- Head to the desired repository (in my case it is under [Clean-Energy](https://github.com/AlAliMazen/Clean-Energy) )

3- In the menubar click on the **Settings**
![GitHub Repository Settings](assets/README-imgs/github-depoyment-setting.png)

4- On the left hand side click Pages menu item ![Pages-on-GitHub](assets/README-imgs/github-pages.png)

5- Under **Build and Deployment** you can see **Sources** where you need to choose the option **Deploy from branch**

6- Last but not least under **Branch** choose the **main** branch if it is master and release version of the project.
![main-branch](assets/README-imgs/github-set-main-branch.png)

7- Finally click on **Save** and GitHub will do the rest.

Bilding the project and deploying it for public may take several minutes depending on the size of the project. On the main repository page, we can see the **Deployment** section when the project is read to be accessed as a final poduct.
![deployment-section](assets/README-imgs/github-deployment-section.png)

### Deploy locally

I commonly use VS Code as my choice of ID. It is the same as the Codeanywhere with the difference that the later runs online using docker im background. 

I managed to clone my GitHub Repo for my project following the steps listed below:

 1. Open VS Code IDE and the Interface will show an option for "Cloning a repository"
 ![img.png](assets/README-imgs/vs-code-start-page.png)

 2. From GitHub Repository page, click on the Code page and copy the https URL to the clipboard
 ![img.png](assets/README-imgs/github-clean-enery-repo.png)
 
 3. Paste the URL of the Repo in the VS-Code after clicking on the **Clone Git Repositoy** option as in the following screen shot:
 ![img.png](assets/README-imgs/vs-code-cloning-repos-url.png)

 4. On the left hand side of the VS-Code, you will see the GitHub Fork Icon has synchronised the files and brought them to your local machine. It will ask you to choose a **local repository** to save the cloned files/project.

 5. Choose a disred direcotry to save the project and the cloned files will show up in the VS-Code
