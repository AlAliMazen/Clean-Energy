# Clean-Energy
ðŸš¨**Required** 

- No doubt that the world suffers under the heavy burden of the the dirty energy and its side effects causing some parts of the world to experince unusual weather change. The Global Warming is just a sign of ho much damage we as investors have done by using the dirty energy resources including oil and coal.
- Clean-Energy sources offers the alternatives towards a world powered by clean and renewable energy. The sources of the clean energy are at the reach of every country and it application fieds are increasing tremdously. Enjoy reading and inform yourself about the sources available to the whole world and take a deep dive into each source and its components, application fields, the problem it solves and challenges by implementing.

following is TODO
- Include a picture of site that shows it in responsive states and links to deployed code: https://ui.dev/amiresponsive

  # UX
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

UX and why you choose or write what I did is still TODO

## Target Audience
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

All who are interested in investing in the green, renewable and sustainable energy resource and need a slight over the systems and the technologies used at very wide scope.

Domestic communiites who want to start investigating about the effectivness of replacingcurrent energy sources which comes from dirty ources including oil, coal or fossils with clean and renewable sources. It helps them drawing a path towards a decision making orientation.

## Project Goals
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

1- Clear and immersive overview on the clean energy resources.
2- Applications fields along promlems solved by clean Nergy resouces
3- Challenges to each resources and barriers prevents from implementing.


## User Stories
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

**I don't get it here what I should write**

This section lists outs as a X I want Y, so I can Z format. It helps drive out the features you will build.

You can have many kinds of users so feel free to have one section or the subsections listed or more

### Colors
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

- As the website discuss the concept of clean, renewable and sustainable energy resources, I start think of nature and its reneable sources. The first color comes in mind is therefor a green where solar system can be applied and constructued on covering green areas without effecting their fertiity for reuse. The sun has a strong dark and light yellow and this is where it comes to the first color to reflect the solar system page. As the sun is the strongest sources, I decided to make the background and hover effects takes their identity from this color.
- Wind blows but with no color, this is where the clean and white color comes in making a high contrast for the text above it.
- As a third color used for fonts and titles, I used the dark and light blue because it reflects the azure color of flowing water and it is also the color of solar panels.

- A combination dark yello, light yellow , dark blue and light blue along with white can be seen in the logo which I designed on canva website.

- The colour pallete can be found on [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palette/00296b-003f88-00509d-fdc500-ffd500)

following screenshot shows the colour theme with its hex-values

### Typography
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

- discuss font size, font types for headers vs buttons vs general text and how it ties into users' emotions or target audience.
- Clarity of letters, putting a capital i next to a lower case L is always a good test
- include screenshots of fonts used and links to the appropriate website ex) https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway

### Imagery
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

Explain why you used certain icons and images on your site & tie it back into your target audience

### Animations and Transitions
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

- discuss any special animations or transitions you've included 
- special hover state effects

## Site Structure
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**


- The clean energy website is built with the idea in mind that the visiter starts totally smoothly by giving a glance about what clean energy is and an where to find its sources, moving to its applications and sum it up by a video about why to move toward clean energy


# Deployment
ðŸš¨**Required** 

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
ðŸš¨**Required** 

Based on the the course content, I applied the following steps to deploy my website to **GitHub Pages**:

1- Log in to GitHub using own credentials (username and password)

2- Head to the desired repository (in my case it is under [Clean-Energy](https://github.com/AlAliMazen/Clean-Energy) )

3- In the menubar click on the **Settings**
![GitHub Repository Settings](assets/README-imgs/github-depoyment-setting.png)

4- On the left hand side click Pages menu item ![Pages-on-GitHub](assets/README-imgs/github-pages.png)

5- Under **Build and Deployment** you can see **Sources** where you need to choose the option **Deploy from branch**

6- Last but not least under **Branch** choose the **main** branch if it is master and release version of the project.
![main-branch](assets/README-imgs/github-set-main-branch.png)

7- Finally click on **Save** and GitHub will do the rest.

Bilding the project and deploying it for public may take several minutes depending on the size of the project. On the main repository page, we can see the **Deployment** section when the project is read to be accessed as a final poduct.

### Deploy locally

I commonly use VS Code as my choice of ID. It is the same as the Codeanywhere with the difference that the later runs online using docker im background. 

I managed to clone my GitHub Repo for my project following the steps listed below:

 1. Open VS Code IDE and the Interface will show an option for "Cloning a repository"
 ![img.png](assets/README-imgs/vs-code-start-page.png)

 2. From GitHub Repository page, click on the Code page and copy the https URL to the clipboard

 3. Paste the URL of the Repo in the VS-Code after clicking on the **Clone Git Repositoy** option as in the following screen shot:
 ![img.png](assets/README-imgs/vs-code-cloning-repos-url.png)

 4. On the left hand side of the VS-Code, you will see the GitHub Fork Icon has synchronised the files and brought them to your local machine. It will ask you to choose a **local repository** to save the cloned files/project.

 5. Choose a disred direcotry to save the project and the cloned files will show up in the VS-Code
